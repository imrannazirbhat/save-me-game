	<h1>Hello there..</h1>
	<p>
	    This project is an individual work carried out in free time. I had started it long ago but due to some incomplete functionalities, it could not be made live. Due to current lockdowns all over, I finally could find sometime to finish it off. And, believe it or not I got more interested to finish it in these days as it very much relates to the current situation. I call the red balls in this game coronovirus and the green ball as human.

		It is a game with the aim to survive among the red balls. The game starts with blank frame having red borders and a green ball falling from top-left corner. After every 5 seconds a new red ball gets produced and you, in control of moving the green ball, will have to try to avoid collusion with walls and red balls. The red balls will keep on adding till 50% mark. Once that is crossed, each red ball will be taken off one by one. Therefore, if you survive till every red ball is vanished, you are the WINNER! I relate the concept of incrementing red balls till 50% to the spread in coronavirus infections and then gradually bringing it down to zero.
